# Inventory Management System

I was given the task of creating an inventory system where customers, products and orders could be created, read, updated and deleted in a sophisticated and simple system. I was given a starter code to fork and complete the code to provide a fully functional application. 

## Getting Started

To deploy the application you can fork the code from my github and open using any IDE compatible with JAVA such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.
There is also an executable JAR file in this repository.

### Prerequisites

To run this application you will need Java 1.8 or later and MySQL 8 or later plus an IDE that can run JAVA applications such as Eclipse.

## Running the tests

Test files can be found in the src/test folder. Methods from the domain, dao and controller classes can be tested. The tests are set up against the sql schema and data found in the src/test/resources folder.
Coverage is currently at 66.3% meaning that this is the percentage of methods being tested.
